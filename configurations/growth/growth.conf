# Example of growing cells
# Division is implemented in a simple way (see tutorial) and new cells are "roughly" inserted into the 
# system. Adding cells usually works fine however in some critial cases cells of extreme shape will cause a crash.
#
# We take some care in setting our parameters so that this introduction of new cells doesn't
# put too great a strain on the system. Lowering the timestep is the only completely reliable 
# way to stabilise the simulation during division.

# Soft repulsion stabilises the simulation in a number of ways.
#
# This potential serves an important purpose during division by affecting a
# soft constraint on the shape of the triangulation.  For an obtuse triangle in
# the triangulation, as its obtuse angle tends to \pi so the radius of the
# circumcircle and the corresponding dual vertex go to infinity. This is not by
# itself a problem however as the obtuse angle becomes large, small movements
# in the associated triangle vertex cause wild changes in the position of the
# dual vertex. we cannot handle this behaviour without drastically reducing the
# timestep. Soft repulsion solves this problem by maintaining some separation
# between the vertices of the triangle.
#
# Again the forces due to this potential are phased in over 100 timesteps.

# Population growth dynamics 
# If death_rate is non-zero then cells may die with probability based on their
# age.  The freq parameter controls the frequency with which Samos checks
# whether cell divisions should occur.  In this case cells will have the
# opportunity to divide every 25 steps. Lower numbers give smoother rate of
# division but that comes at the cost of extra computation.  Cells have their
# preferred area increased at a rate set by 'growth_rate'.  Cells can divide if
# their area is greater than max_area and do so with a probability that
# increases linearly with area and with the factor 'division_rate'.
