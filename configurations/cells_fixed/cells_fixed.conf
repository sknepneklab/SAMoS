# The triangulation flag indicates that our particles are vertices of a mesh and we are running a cell simulation.
# The static_boundary flag prohibits the addition of new boundary particles which is required when, for example,
# the cells grow and divide. In this case we don't need this flag since the boundary forms a dense fixed ring and
# so the criteria for adding additional boundary particles will never be satisfied.
